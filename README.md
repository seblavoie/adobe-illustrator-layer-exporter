# Adobe Illustrator Sublayer Helper

This script will unlock and make visible all layers and, recursively, their sub-layers. It will then copy each top-level layer into a new illustrator file and save it on the desktop.

Todo: Make a file dialog instead of saving to desktop.

## Installation

Save `Clean Sublayers.jsx` in your scripts folder.

- Windows: `Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator <version>\Presets\<language>/Scripts`
- OS X: `/Applications/Illustrator <version>/Presets/<language>/Scripts`
